grid-auto-row: It defines the size of implicitly created rows in a CSS grid layout. When grid items are placed in rows beyond the explicitly defined rows, grid-auto-row determines the size of these automatically generated rows.

grid-auto-column: Similarly, it defines the size of implicitly created columns in a CSS grid layout. When grid items are placed in columns beyond the explicitly defined columns, grid-auto-column determines the size of these automatically generated columns.

In short, these properties help specify the size of rows and columns that are created automatically to accommodate grid items that do not fit within the explicitly defined grid structure.
