Precedence and Associativity:
Precedence: Determines the order of operator evaluation (higher precedence first).
Associativity: Specifies the order for operators of the same precedence (left-to-right or right-to-left).
Importance: Ensures correct expression evaluation, readability, and aids debugging.
Example: (3 + 5) * 2 ensures addition is performed first.
