Unary Operators: Operate on one operand (e.g., ++, --, -).
let x = 5;
let y = -x; // Unary minus (changes the sign of x)
let z = ++x; // Increment (adds 1 to x)



Binary Operators: Operate on two operands (e.g., +, -, *).
let a = 7;
let b = 3;
let sum = a + b; // Addition
let product = a * b; // Multiplication



Ternary Operator: Takes three operands and is a shorthand for if-else (e.g., condition ? expr1 : expr2).
let age = 20;
let status = (age >= 18) ? "Adult" : "Minor";
