Categorization of Operators in JavaScript:
Arithmetic Operators:
Perform mathematical operations.
Example: +, -, *, /, % (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus).
Comparison Operators:
Compare values and return a Boolean result.
Example: ==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <= (equal, strict equal, not equal, strict not equal, greater than, less than, greater than or equal, less than or equal).
Logical Operators:
Combine or manipulate Boolean values.
Example: && (and), || (or), ! (not).
Assignment Operators:
Assign values to variables.
Example: =, +=, -=, *=, /= (assignment, addition assignment, subtraction assignment, multiplication assignment, division assignment).
Unary Operators:
Operate on a single operand.
Example: ++, -- (increment, decrement).
Conditional (Ternary) Operator:
Provides a concise way to write conditional statements.
Example: condition ? expr1 : expr2.
Bitwise Operators:
Perform bitwise operations on integers.
Example: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>, >>> (bitwise AND, OR, XOR, NOT, left shift, right shift, unsigned right shift).
These categories cover the diverse functionality of operators in JavaScript.
