            <h2>Bhagat Singh</h2>
            <p>Bhagat Singh, an indomitable revolutionary and a prominent freedom fighter, was born on September 28, 1907, in Banga, Punjab, British India. His fervor for independence was ignited by witnessing the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in 1919, propelling him into the nationalist movement at a young age. Bhagat Singh became a central figure in the fight against British colonial rule.

                In 1928, Singh and his associates plotted to avenge the death of Lala Lajpat Rai during a protest against the Simon Commission. The plan, however, went awry, leading to the death of British police officer J.P. Saunders. Subsequently, Singh and his comrades courted arrest, and during their trial in the Lahore Conspiracy Case, Singh used the courtroom as a platform to articulate his vision for a liberated India.
                
                Despite international appeals for clemency, Bhagat Singh, along with Rajguru and Sukhdev, was executed on March 23, 1931, in Lahore Central Jail at the age of 23. His sacrifice became a catalyst for the independence movement, inspiring generations with his resolute dedication to the cause. Bhagat Singh's legacy endures as a symbol of fearlessness, patriotism, and the unwavering pursuit of justice in the annals of India's struggle for freedom. His contributions are commemorated annually on Shaheed Diwas (Martyrs' Day) to honor the sacrifice of these valiant revolutionaries.</p>

        <h2>Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose</h2>
        <p>Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, a charismatic and fearless leader in India's struggle for independence, was born on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack, Odisha. His unwavering commitment to freeing India from British rule earned him immense respect and admiration. Bose's leadership extended beyond conventional norms, marked by his daring escapades and bold decisions.

            A prominent figure in the Indian National Congress, Bose diverged from Mahatma Gandhi's non-violent approach, advocating for a more direct and forceful path to independence. His famous slogan "Give me blood, and I shall give you freedom" resonated with the fervor of those yearning for liberation.
            
            During World War II, Bose sought international support for India's cause and formed the Indian National Army (INA) with Japanese assistance. The INA played a significant role in the Burma campaign, aiming to liberate India from British occupation.
            
            Bose's mysterious disappearance in 1945 added an air of intrigue to his legacy. Though the circumstances surrounding his death remain uncertain, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose's impact on India's struggle for freedom is indelible. His legacy lives on in the hearts of millions, and his contributions to the nation are commemorated annually on his birth anniversary as Netaji Jayanti. His life is a testament to the indomitable spirit and sacrifice required to achieve the noble goal of national independence.</p>
