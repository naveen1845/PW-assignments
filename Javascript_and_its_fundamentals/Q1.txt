JavaScript is a versatile programming language primarily used for web development. It enables interactive and dynamic content on websites by allowing developers to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), handle events, and communicate with servers. JavaScript is commonly used alongside HTML and CSS to create responsive and engaging web applications, making it an essential component of front-end development. It can also be employed on the server-side (Node.js) for full-stack development, enhancing the overall user experience and functionality of web applications.
