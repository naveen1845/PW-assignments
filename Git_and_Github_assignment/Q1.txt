Version control, also known as source code management (SCM) or revision control, is a system that tracks changes to a set of files over time. It is an essential aspect of software development that helps developers manage and coordinate changes to the source code of a software project. The primary goals of version control are to:

Track Changes: Version control systems keep a record of every change made to the source code, including who made the change, when it was made, and what the changes were. This historical record allows developers to review and understand the evolution of the codebase.

Collaboration: In collaborative software development environments, multiple developers may be working on the same project simultaneously. Version control enables seamless collaboration by providing a centralized repository where developers can share their changes, merge modifications, and resolve conflicts.

Backup and Recovery: Version control acts as a backup mechanism, allowing developers to roll back to previous versions of the code if a problem arises. This helps prevent data loss and provides a safety net in case of accidental changes or errors.

Branching and Merging: Version control systems allow developers to create branches, which are isolated copies of the codebase. This is useful for working on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase. Branches can be later merged back into the main codebase, incorporating the changes made in isolation.

Traceability: With version control, it is possible to trace every change made to the codebase, making it easier to identify when and why specific modifications were introduced. This traceability is crucial for debugging, auditing, and understanding the project's history.

Facilitates Release Management: Version control plays a crucial role in managing software releases. It helps label and track specific versions of the code that correspond to releases, making it easier to deploy and maintain different versions of the software.

Popular version control systems include Git, Mercurial, and Subversion. Git, in particular, has gained widespread adoption in the software development community due to its distributed nature and robust branching and merging capabilities.

In summary, version control is a fundamental tool in software development that enhances collaboration, facilitates change tracking, provides backup and recovery options, and supports efficient management of codebase versions throughout the development lifecycle.
